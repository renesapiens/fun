Alright if you came to this place maybe you are looking for some fun.
The intention of this repository is just to work as container for the
few HackerRank problems that I'm solving. Most of them are solved with
maybe the first solution that came to my mind and some are optimized
for sure. As you know it depends of the available time assigned to each
one. Ok, I hope you find something useful here. Feel free to contact me
back if you have any suggestion :)
